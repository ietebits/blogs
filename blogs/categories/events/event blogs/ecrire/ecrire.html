        <p><i>“It has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity.” — <b>Albert Einstein</b></i></p><br>

        <p>Technology has enriched our lives with greater convenience, improved access to information, and revolutionised how we work.

        <p>In this arduous time of pandemic, when everything seems to be gloomy and sorrowful, the <b>IETE Students' Forum of BIT Sindri</b> was upto something refreshing and enthralling again for the students to heed their interest in technical scope and giving them the opportunity to showcase their skills. The IETE Students' Forum BIT Sindri is extremely ecstatic to announce the victorious event <b>“ECRIRE”, Blogg-O-Battle</b> which took place between 8th Feb to 25th March 2021.</p><br>
        
        <p><b>Ecrire was an online blog writing event on technical topics.</b> Blogging is a way to put your thoughts in words and express your soul out, promotes students to become better reader and writer. Moreover, when it comes to education, blogging can be an excellent tool for improving a student's involvement, excitement and most importantly, writing skills.</p><br>

A short description out of blog was also published on our official Facebook page - fb.com/ietebits. Our event was sponsored by <b>Outscal</b> and <b>Rosenfeld</b> as our Education partner, <b>Give My Certificate</b> as our Certificate partner, <b>1Password</b> as out Security partner.</p><br>
        
        <p>We are delighted to announce that we got almost 50+ breathtaking entries from our and different colleges as well. The imagination and the enthusiasm of participants was beyond our expectations. They explored fresh and fascinating topic and presented their best stuff. Their ardour was flowing out of the pot, moreover they were looking more excited than our team.</p><br>
        
        <p>In the initial stage of the event, within a week or two we got almost 10+ entries. The creativity and imagination skills shown by the participants were too good. There were so many diverse and trending topics like Artificial Intelligence, Blockchain, Cryptocurrency, Cyber Security and so many relatable topics that are so much in stipulation at the present time or will have a huge effect in the future. There were some highbrow topics that are quiet unknown but have a great significance for example: Smart Fabric, DDoS Attack, Dyson Swarm, YAG Laser, Skytran and specific other topics. Each draft was too knowledgeable and easily understandable that the one who don't have any prior idea about the topic can understand them too because the students portrayed them so well in an organised manner. They got appreciated by all the geeks.</p><br>
        
        <p>Entries of the participants were judged on the basis of the technical content of the blog, creativity and error free composition. The content was required to be plagiarism free. <b>The prizes worth 15k and the participation certificate was awarded to all registered candidates.</b> The top two blogs were featured on our official blogsite, that are “On Sunday Night” and “Linguistic Relativity”.</p><br>
        
        <p>All-inclusive the event was a great success not only because it got huge participation but because of its idea behind i.e., to give them a platform to develop their imagination and blogging skills. Anyone can easily reach the blogs to get the brief regarding any topics. Anyone can visit our blogsite ecrire.ietebits.com for picking ideas regarding any technical topics.</p><br>
