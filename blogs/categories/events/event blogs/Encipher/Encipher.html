        <p><em>"Software is like entropy. It is difficult to grasp, weighs nothing, and obeys the second law of thermodynamics; i.e. it always increases."</em><br>-Norman Ralph Augustine</p><br>
        <p>Today we are living in the era of elevating coding culture and one of the primary element in the world of coding is competitive programming hence their is an increasing necessity of exposure to competitive programming. To ensure the technophiles do not lack in this arena IETE Students' Forum launched an engrossing event <b>“Encipher"</b>. The word <b>“Encipher”</b> means to convert something into a <b>coded form</b>. The principle objective of the event was to provide students a platform to practice, show case there coding skills and also to make callow coders get acquainted to the environment of contests in coding. </p><br><br>
         
        <h3>What is competitive programming? </h3><br>

        <p>Competitive programming is considered as a mental sport for programmers in which they are required to solve problems through code within provided constraints. Competitive programming not only helps building an attractive resume, helps in preparation of coding round of various esteemed multi national software companies but it also inculcates various other skills in a coder such as developing logical thinking, fast thinking ability and makes one more focused. The event was also designed in a way which gave similar experience to the participants and helped them gain maximum benefits out of the entire event.</p><br>

        <p><b>IETE Students' Forum</b> successfully organised this enormous coding contest, accumulating a large number of participants under the guidance of <b>Career Development Centre, BIT Sindri</b>. </p><br><br>

        <h3>The Launching event:</h3><br>
        <p>Encipher was launched in an exciting webinar successfully conducted by IETE Students' Forum on the topic <b>“How To crack product based company”</b>. In this webinar <b>Mr. Monu Kumar an expert at Coding Blocks</b> guided students for there career in coding. The suggestions given by our guest speaker also emphasized on getting involved in the practice of competitive coding. </p><br><br>
        
        <h3>About the event:</h3><br>
        <p>The event commenced on 11th July,2022 on the platform <b>Hackerblocks</b> which occurred for a span of 14 days,  participants were required to solve two questions everyday within a given time limit.</p><br>
        <p>The questions in the initial days were less complicated so as to ensure our new born coders also enjoy the event and develop their skills to improve themselves. However later on the questions became complicated ensuring the event do not become less interesting for other participants. The number of questions solved and the time taken to solve questions were recorded for each participant.</p><br><br>

        <h3>Sponsors: </h3><br>
        <p>The <b>sponsors of the event</b> were: <b>Geeks For Geeks</b>, <b>Stubborn Factory</b> and <b>Coding Blocks</b>. These companies are doing wonders in imparting education in the field of coding and development. We are grateful to them for honouring us with their sponsorship. We await the opportunity to collaborate with them in our future endeavours as well and come up with various such events that promotes coding culture among all the coders.</p><br><br>

        <h3>Leader board and awards: </h3><br>
        <p>The leader board was updated everyday based on the accuracy of the question solved and the amount of time taken for the same. The one who solved maximum questions in a timely manner was declared as the winner. <b>The top contestants were presented with a t-shirt proclaiming "grandmaster of BIT" and other exciting prizes as well</b>. Certificates were provided to all the participants.</p><br>
        <p>The top five winners of the event are:- </p><br>
        <ul style=“list-style-type:disc”>
            <li>Unnat Kumar</li>
            <li>Hardik Agarwal</li>
            <li>Pranav Singh</li>
            <li>Priyanshu Malviya</li>
            <li>Sandeep Hembrom</li>
        </ul><br><br>
        <p>A famous saying is, <em>"A quitter never wins and a winner never quits"</em> hence we expect those who could not win the competition would not quit and apply various things they learnt during the event in their future contests.</p><br><br>
