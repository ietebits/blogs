        <h2>INTRODUCTION:</h2><br>
        <p>It's never late to commence something exotic. The moment you set your time t=0, your countdown begins. Packing up all the amazing dread-filled in our pockets we should start from zero!!></p><br>
        <p><b>IETE Students' Forum, BIT Sindri</b> is extremely delighted to endorse the successful conduction of one such excited session setting up All about APIs which was held in collaboration with <b>Postman.</b> The session was fully shrouded from the beginner to advance level highlighting the Essentials of APIs. Our eloquent speaker for the session was <b>Mr. Abhishek Ranjan,</b> Postman Student Expert in BIT Sindri. Attending online sessions with a full unique package, of knowledge and interaction makes us different from the crowd of thousands and gives us sharp wisdom of outflow.</p><br>
        <p>Curving this thought we also covered an interactive live Quiz session. The <b>top 3 winners</b> also got amazing swags by Postman. Concluding the session clarifies all your qualms related to APIs.</p><br><br>
        <h3>Discussion on the need, role, and working of API.</h3><br>
        <p>The discussion continued on the need to efficiently share vast amounts of data across various departments and with citizens is an issue that faces most government officials today.</p><br>
        <p>A key tool to tackling this challenge is the <b>Application Programming Interface (API),</b> which at its most basic acts as a door or window into a software program, allowing other programs to interact with it without the need for a developer to share its entire code. “For example, an API would allow a mobile app, set-top box, or another connected device in a home to communicate with a service,” said <b>Greg Brail, chief architect with Apigee.</b> “The company exposes an API that tells a programmer how they will interact with the service. The API could be open to customers or just people inside their own company.”</p><br><br>
        <h3>Concepts of API and requests</h3><br><br>
        <p>Few details related to the concepts of API were being discussed. If you specialize in apps or software development, you must have come across the term API. This is the short form for <b>APPLICATION PROGRAMMING SOFTWARE,</b> and it technically refers to a robust set of procedures, tools, and protocols that permit the interaction between web applications. It is an intermediary that delivers a client's request to the server and then returns a response to the client.</p><br>
        <p>APIs help software developers streamline and shorten the application building process by eliminating frequently repeated program development processes.</p><br>
        <p>Since APIs have become part and parcel of our daily life, they are involved in almost everything we do on the world wide web. <b>An API request occurs when a developer adds an endpoint to a URL and makes a call to the server.</b></p><br><br>
        <h3>Interpretation on API design & Methods to make it better</h3><br>
        <p>API design refers to the method of developing application programming interfaces (APIs) that expose data and application functionality to be used by developers and users. APIs are important to modern organizations, adding new capabilities to everything from their operations and products to their partnership strategies. An API's design gives a comprehensive overview of all the endpoints and <b>CRUD operations</b> related to each of them. An effective API design can greatly help in implementation and prevent complicated configurations. The design process will also help you think through exactly how your data will be distributed and how your core product will work. Good API design improves the usability of your API, leading to higher adoption, fewer headaches, and an overall better chance of success for your API endeavors.</p><br><br>
        <h3>Elucidation on benefits of API and why to prefer over others!!</h3><br>
        <p>Following up, the speaker went on to speak about the advantages of APIs. He explained how APIs are automated and can manage the work without any manual intervention. It also automatically publishes the generated content and makes it available for every channel, which makes the distribution easier. Personalization is another major advantage of API which lets companies customize the content and services that they use the most. He also explained how API provides an integrated user experience by allowing the content to be embedded from any site easily. Overall, by stating these pros of API, he gave enough reasons to why API has become so much vital in today's web world.</p><br><br>
        <h3>Interactive discussion on POSTMAN cloud</h3><br>
        <p>In the webinar of API postman, we were explained about the Application Programming Interface in which our speaker Abhishek Ranjan sir discussed API that it is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. He also added that the services are exposed on the internet and can be accessed by anyone and may have untrusted users. Use multi-factor authentication. Consider implementing <b>JIT( Just In Time )</b> access for resources. Use stable AuthN and AuthZ platforms. Requires re-authentication for some actions ( eg. Financial transactions).</p><br>
        <p>He also discussed the benefits of APIs which are:-</p><br>
        <ul style=“list-style-type:disc”>
            <li>No software required.</li>
            <li>Online development and development tools.</li>
            <li>Resources were available on the network.</li>
            <li>On-demand self-service. Cost-effective.</li>
            <li>High-efficiency reliability and flexibility.</li>
            <li>Applications as utilities over the internet.</li>
            <li>Manipulates and configures apps online.</li>
        </ul><br><br>
        <h3>Exciting quiz on API POSTMAN</h3><br>
        <p>Learning can be made exciting and fun with a quiz. The session was followed by an exciting online quiz full of amazement and learning. Quite a several students got themselves enrolled in this informative quiz. <b>The quiz winner had an exciting prize.</b> It was a super-fun and highly informative time with this <b>fun facts quiz!</b> We've put together some of the most interesting, shocking, and jaw-dropping knowledge to amaze the audience.</p><br><br>
        <h3>CONCLUSION</h3><br>
        <p>The workshop ended with a colossal triumph. The session was highly conjunctive, and the participants enjoyed the hands-on workshop. The workshop aimed to incite tech-geeks to upskill themselves by acquiring a deep knowledge of APIs from scratch. It focused on making requests, testing APIs & developing APIs. The participants also got familiar with <b>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).</b> Though the session was completely beginner-friendly there was something for everyone to learn. The webinar proved to be one of the enthralling and most interesting hands-on sessions. The attendees also got their queries resolved, at the end resulting which the chat being highly active and there were regular questions in the chat. The nail-biting quiz at the end of the session was the showstopper. <b>The winners were awarded amazing swags by Postman.</b> The feedback received from the attendees was astounding for us. We hope to conduct more such workshops for the betterment of our youth</p>
