<p>IoT stands for Internet of Things as the name is clearly speaking is just a network of physical objects(things) that are embedded with sensors, software and other technologies for the aim of connecting and enhancing information with different devices over the web. IoT devices include sensors, software, actuators and other computer devices. IoT works by collecting high volume machine generated data from a variety of sensors to support real time operations.</p><br><br>

<h3><b>Brief History:</b></h3><br>

<p>In the twentieth century computer and our daily use gadgets were brain without senses. They can do things for us but they only know what we told them. But in the present scenario we have developed a network in which our devices can sense and act just like us. They are ready to take decision and work on a task with just a tap on our phone. The word "IoT" was coined by Kevin Ashton in 1999 during his work at Procter&Gamble. The term IoT did not accelerate until 2011 but reached mass market in late 2013.</p><br><br>

<h3><b>Technology in IoT:</b></h3><br>

<p>Don't confuse IOT with other technologies like M2M, Industrial Internet, Web of things, Internet of everything, Industry 4.0 or just internet. loT has a wider context from these technologies and has greater scope. The APN protocol <b>IPv6</b> that we are using today is a network layer protocol that is central to IoT and was launched publicly in 2011. Since then interconnected devices have become commonplace in our everyday lives. With the advent of IoT most of the daily life appliances can be connected with internet and sensors. We can connect the light, fan, doors, windows and much of our room to our phone. Just with a tap we can open them or close. We all might have been scolded by our mothers for refrigerator door not closed properly but with IoT we will simply get a notification on our smart phones that door is open. All the things that we usually forget will be reminded just by notifications. If fuel is low in our vehicle, if smoke chimney is not working, if geyser is ready, if water tank is empty and various other daily life applications will be controlled by IoT. Let's see such apps that can be very useful for us:</p><br>

<ul style=“list-style-type:disc”>
    <li><b>DASH-</b> Android and ios app that keeps you informed about your car current status and maintenance needs.</li>
    <li><b>ZUBIE-</b> Offer real time GPS fleet tracking while mentoring vehicle health and driver performance.</li>
    <li><b>INSTEON-</b> Controls lighting appliances and also monitors water leaks, smoke and windows and door.</li>
    <li><b>EYELOCK-</b> Iris(eyes) based identity authentication technology.</li>
    <li><b>AT HOME SOLUTIONS-</b> It provide home security, smart lighting and also climate control products</li>
</ul><br>
<p><i><b>And many more but we can also work on these topics by writing codes and programming using Micontroller, Arduino and other hardwares.</b></i></p><br><br>

<h3><b>Introduction to Arduino:</b></h3><br>

<p>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects. By using arduino boards and programming skills we can simply connect devices with IoT technology. The open-source Arduino Software (IDE) is used to write code. This code can be uploaded on any arduino board. The boards can be programmed using C and C++ language using a standard API which is known as the arduino language.</p><br><br>

<h3><b>Future and Market share:</b></h3><br>

<p>In near future IoT manufacturers will focus on designing industry oriented projects rather than general needs. The global remote monitoring market is expected to reach $1386.06 billion by 2026, according to Grand view Research. 26% of the market share in IoT globally is by smart cities. Following it industries are also dedicated to IoT making a share of 24%. The rest 50% is shared by smart homes, smart cars and other utilities.</p><br><br>

<h3><b>Security will remain a dead end:</b></h3><br>
<p>Despite the efforts of government to strengthen IoT security regulators and improve security level mechanisms and data security but privacy problems will never diminish. Cybercriminals use more and more sophisticated practices in order to enroot in connected devices, thereby gaining access to private information. IoT security is the leading barrier to widespread IoT adaption.</p><br>

<p><i>"Some people think we have already learned how to make systems completely secure, and that the IoT can avoid the issues that plague the internet today. But this optimism is unwarranted and even dangerous in how it creates complacency. The real takeaway here is that attacks are inevitable. In 10-15 years, expect IoT security to remain an essential part of this conversation."</i><br><B>-Jonathan Penn</B><br><b>Director of Strategy at Avast</b></p><br><br>

<h3><b>IoT in Blockchain:</b></h3><br>

<p>The combination of IoT and blockchain offers various benefits and allows a smart device to function itself without the need of a centralized network. It can also track how devices communicate with each other, thereby increasing security levels in blockchain. IoT-blockchain technology is in its initial stages and a fewer companies like IBM have begun to seek opportunities in this space. Key benefits of using blockchain for IoT is building trust, reduce costs and accelerating transactions.</p><br><br>

<h3><b>Final thoughts:</b></h3><br>

<p>Outlining the past, present and future of IoT we've come to the conclusion that interconnected technology is on the path of development despite of cybersecurity challenges. It is guaranteed that it will evolve in the coming years making mankind more lazy. The way we are living life now will be changed to a great extent.</p><br>
